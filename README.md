# CodeFX

This is the place where we tell you, who we are, what this project is all about and why you really need it!

## Who?

Well, we must disappoint you: there is no "we". Currently it's only me, Nicolai. ;)

## What?

And the answer to _What?_ might also be underwhelming as I can't really tell you what will come of this. It will at least involve _JavaFX_ (hence the name) and some collections. In general, I've got two things in mind:
* I wanna search my projects for reusable chunks of code. Whatever I find will be redesigned, tested, well-documented and finally published here.
* I've got some ideas of things I'd like to implement and see where it takes me.

## Why?

So why should you use this? Yes, why indeed...

Until this very hazy text changes, you should not use this code as-is. Check it out, look at it, get some ideas, change it, use it, ... go crazy with it! (But remember, it's licensed under GPL.) At some point, a part of the code will become stable and there will be releases - at least that's the hope. ;)
