/**
 * This package provides functionality around <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29">trees</a>.
 * <p>
 * Its main purpose is to enable easy creation of streams of nodes over tree-like data structures without requiring them
 * to implement a fixed interface. Instead of utilizing such an interface to navigate the tree, a
 * {@link org.codefx.libfx.collection.tree.TreeNavigator TreeNavigator} is used.
 * <p>
 * TODO more documentation
 * <p>
 * TODO: implement breadth-first search; implement TreeNavigator for JavaFX' scene graph and Swing's component graph;
 * revise package structure
