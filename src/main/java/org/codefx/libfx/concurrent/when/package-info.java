 * With {@link org.codefx.libfx.concurrent.when.ExecuteOnceWhen ExecuteOnceWhen} and
 * {@link org.codefx.libfx.concurrent.when.ExecuteAlwaysWhen ExecuteAlwaysWhen} this package provides two classes which
 * help to make sure some action which is triggered by a change on an {@link javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue
 * ObservableValue} gets executed under threading. Refer to the two classes for a detailed description.
 * <p>
 * Instances of those classes can be built with {@link org.codefx.libfx.concurrent.when.ExecuteWhen ExecuteWhen}.
